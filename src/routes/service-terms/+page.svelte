                <li>Breaches of advertising or marketing laws occurring due to the User's use of the Software or their use of the output created by their use of the Software;</li>

This clause qualifies the clause on Intellectual Property Rights ownership immediately preceding this clause. Subject to the indemnities set out above, the User is responsible for ensuring that it does not use any such Software output in a way that infringes on the Intellectual Property Rights of any other parties.</li>
            </ol>

The Software is compatible with current versions of major browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) that support standard web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript and HTTPS). To use the Software, the User must have a stable internet connection and a device capable of uploading and downloading image files.

                <li>If the User is a Consumer, the User has a statutory right to cancel the Agreement (e.g. their purchase of access to the Software) within a period of 14 days from the date of purchase. However, by accepting these Terms of Use, the User expressly requests the Provider to grant the User immediate access to the Software following the acceptance of the Terms of Use and the User acknowledges that, in making such a request, they waive the right to cancel as described.</li>

The Software runs on our servers and processes files in memory only; uploaded files are not permanently stored once processing is complete. The Software does not include any region coding and does not apply digital rights management (DRM) or other technical restrictions to the files you download, beyond standard format and size limits (for example, maximum file size per upload and limits on the number of images per batch in the free tier).</li>

            <h3>Circumstances Beyond the Control of Either Party (Force Majeure)</h3>
            <ol start="45">
                <li>Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations under this Agreement (e.g. provision of payment or of Software) where such failure or delay results from any cause that is beyond the reasonable control of that Party.</li>
                <li>Such causes include, but are not limited to: power failure, Internet Service Provider failure, acts of God, epidemic, pandemic, civil unrest, fire, flood, droughts, storms, earthquakes, collapse of buildings, explosion or accident, acts of terrorism, acts of war, governmental action, any law, or any action taken by a government or public authority, including without limitation imposing an export or import restriction, quota, or prohibition, or any other event that is beyond the control of the Party in question.</li>
                <li>The Party affected by a circumstance beyond its control shall use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the circumstance upon the performance of its obligations.</li>
                <li>The corresponding obligations of the other Party will be suspended to the same extent as those of the Party affected by the force majeure event.</li>
                <li>If the delay continues for a period of 30 days, either Party may terminate the Agreement. Other termination methods, as set out above in the section headed “Term and Termination” may, if applicable, be used to end the Agreement before such a 30-day period has elapsed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>General Terms</h3>
            <ol start="50">
                <li>If the User is a Business Customer placing an order on behalf of a business, the User confirms that they have the necessary authority to place the relevant order for and on behalf of that business.</li>
                <li>The Agreement contains the whole agreement between the Parties relating to its subject matter and supersedes all prior discussions, arrangements, or agreements that might have taken place in relation to the Agreement. Nothing in this clause limits or excludes any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
                <li>Except as allowed above, neither Party may assign, transfer, sub-licence, or sub-contract to any third party the benefit and/or burden of the Agreement or of any of the rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of the other Party.</li>
                <li>No variation of the Agreement will be valid or binding unless it is recorded in writing and signed by or on behalf of both Parties, except that:</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>Changes may be made by the Provider in accordance with other terms of these Terms of Use; and</li>
                <li>Changes may be made by the Provider to these Terms of Use. The version of the Terms of Use that applies to a specific Agreement are those that are current on the Effective Date. Notification of any changes to the Terms of Use will be made in writing either in a manner that brings notice to the User's attention before they next use the Software (e.g. via a pop-up on a login screen) or via direct communication with the User (e.g. by email). If changes are made to the Terms of Use, the User's use of the Software after the changes are communicated and implemented is deemed to constitute their acceptance of the new Terms. If the User does not wish to accept the new Terms of Use, they can terminate the Agreement in accordance with the provisions above in the section headed “Term and Termination”.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="54">
                <li>The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 does not apply to the Agreement and no third party has any right to enforce or rely on any provision of the Agreement.</li>
                <li>Unless otherwise agreed, no delay, act, or omission by a Party in exercising any right or remedy available in relation to this Agreement will be deemed a waiver of that, or any other, right or remedy.</li>
                <li>If any court or competent authority finds that any provision or part of the Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision or part will, to the extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of the Agreement will not be affected.</li>
                <li>Nothing in the Agreement will establish any employment relationship, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties, or mean that one Party becomes the agent of the other Party, nor does the Agreement authorise any Party to enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other Party.</li>
                <li>Any notice (other than in legal proceedings) to be delivered under the Agreement must be in writing and delivered by email to the email address provided in these Terms of Use (for notices sent to the Provider) or to the email provided by the User when the User registers their account used to access the Software (for notices sent to the User).</li>
